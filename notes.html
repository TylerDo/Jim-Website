Notes for styling commands in Bootstrap
	
	Classes:
	As such, components should be built with a base class that houses common, not-to-be overridden property-value pairs.
	For example, .btn and .btn-primary. We use .btn for all the common styles like display, padding, and border-width.
	We then use modifiers like .btn-primary to add the color, background-color, border-color, etc.

	Modifier classes should only be used when there are multiple properties or values to be changed across multiple variants.
	Modifiers are not always necessary, so be sure you’re actually saving lines of code and preventing unnecessary overrides when creating them.
	Good examples of modifiers are our theme color classes and size variants.
	
	You'll see me reference many classes you can view docs to see more in depth of how they work.
	
	Margins:
	mx = margins x;
	my = margins y;
	
	Padding:
	px = padding x;
	py = padding y;
